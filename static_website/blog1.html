       <h3>Why Should the Food Supply Chain Go Digital? </h3>
       <p align="justify">Digital India has become a vision for India. Everything should be accessible at the tip of one's finger, 
        including the most recent advances in science and technology. These were the remarks used by Prime Minister 
        Narendra Modi in 2015 to introduce the Digital India initiative.Digitalization is the transformation of a business model using digital technologies in order to increase 
        revenue and value-added opportunities. It is the transition to a digital business model. Due to its ability
         to significantly alter how organisations operate by enhancing their internal business processes, it has 
         swept the corporate world by storm. </p>
         <br>
         <p align="justify">Numerous opportunities for innovation have arisen as a result of the digital revolution of business
           in all sectors.We observe a full reinvention of the products, services, and experiences that are offered
           to the market in every industry, from retail to life sciences, from medicines to banking.Businesses 
           need to understand that, in today's world, they must use digital channels to interact with their key
           stakeholders. </p>
          <br>
          <p align="justify">
            Indian farmers and stakeholders' lives could be significantly impacted by digital technologies, 
            which will have the ability to completely change the country's agricultural industry. Unsustainable
            resource use, diminishing farm production, and the quickly rising demand for nutritious food are
            some of the main issues facing Indian agriculture. These can be overcome by deploying digital 
            technologies and infrastructure in a scalable and sustainable manner. As SarvM mainly focuses on digitization of the food supply chain .It has made it feasible for 
            restaurants and farms to better interact and reach out to more customers. It can solve every retailer's
            need to succeed online, attract more customers and get exposure.It guarantees fair prices for farmers,
            prompt shipments to retailers, and client food safety. </p>
         <br>
         <p align="justify">As modern consumers are aware of what they purchase and customers value brands that go beyond just 
          labelling the package and provide comprehensive information about the products. Sarvm also promotes 
          transparency and traceability in the supply chain for better confidence between buyers and sellers.
          In fact, as time goes on, the use of technology in food chains is only going to increase.It is safe 
          to argue that technology has significantly improved the end-to-end procedure.  </p>
        <br>
        <p>Why is it necessary to take action on digital transformation right away? </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <h2>The main factors here could be :</h2>
          <ul>
             <li> More Timely and Accurate Data Gathering. </li>
             <li>Safer products and practices. </li>
             <li>More profitability and effectiveness. </li>
             <li>Keeping Up with the Pace of the Market. </li>
            
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p> Now does digitalization help them achieve this? It does. </p>
        <br>
        <p> 
          <h2>How? Let’s see. </h2>
           
        </p>
        <p align="justify">Radically new methods of providing value to clients are now possible because of digital technologies. India is the centre of attraction worldwide and is regarded as a knowledge powerhouse.The world's 
          opinion of India's knowledge and talent base has shifted as a result of the exponential growth of the 
          country's IT sector over the past 20 years, which has also fueled economic expansion.Due to government of India programmes 
          like Digital India, Skill India, and the JAM trinity, 
          the prevalence of digital technology has significantly expanded in our nation. Over 480 million 
          people in the world use digital devices. Of those, 390 million use their mobile phones to access 
          the internet. Therefore, one may provide their clients better, speedier, and value-driven services
           by developing mobile apps and websites. </p>
        <br>
        <p >
          <h2>Some of the benefits of technology in food supply chain:</h2>
          <ol>
             <li> Avoid waste and maximise efficiency.  </li>
             <li>Enhance traceability. </li>
             <li>Enables for efficient, highly networked food supply systems. </li>
             <li>Operational effectiveness overall. </li>
             <li>Food safety and a flexible framework for food recalls and tracing. </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p align="justify"><h2>The use of digital technologies expands the market.</h2> 
          Digital technology has changed competitive landscapes by achieving a domain transformation in their 
          organisations. SarvM is here to make an impact and bring futuristic solutions to solve every retailer's
           need, to succeed online and gain more customers and exposure.It links buyers, sellers, traders,

       <h3>Using digital technologies effectively creates income. </h3>
      <p align="justify">Both money and time are saved. In order to minimise costs, documents are stored in the cloud in digital format.
         Both the need for office space and the price of stationery have decreased. Numerous billable work hours are required for
          printing, sorting, and filing, which raises the price of the final output.
      </p>
         <br>
         <h3>Encourages the development of a cashless economy </h3>
         <p align="justify">Cash can also be used for illegal operations including tax avoidance and the laundering of illicit funds.
           Therefore, moving all transactions online encourages a cashless society. In order to encourage digital payments in small
            enterprises, the government has launched a number of initiatives and programmes. </p>
          <br>
          <h3>It promotes greater sales: </h3>
          <p align="justify">
            Aside from hiring vendors and opening storefronts, door-to-door sales were the norm prior to the advent of digitization. 
            This entire process required a lot of work. In Digital India, Marketing Automation Tools (MAT) are now a blessing in this
             area. When a business does this, they are able to monitor consumer behaviour and monetise its courtesy MAT to enhance
              their sales. This helps them do more than only sell their items through the website. </p>
         <br>
         <p align="justify">Digital can improve government services and the efficiency of India’s job market. 
          As India is one of the largest and fastest-growing marketplaces for digital consumers and digitisation,
           with more than half a billion internet subscribers.India has demonstrated excellent leadership skills 
           while undergoing a digital transition.So, in the food supply chain market, SarvM will serve as a 
           one-stop shop for any business activities.
